## What is Verlet List

A Verlet list (named after Loup Verlet) is a data structure in molecular dynamics simulations to efficiently maintain a list of all particles within a given cut-off distance of each other[1].

Verlet List â€“ scales with N2
Loop over i and j
Calculate distance between i and j
If less than rverlet add to neighbor list
