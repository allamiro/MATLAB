# Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography
### Developing MATLAB Files for ECC Crypto Guide

Introduction and Overview

Elliptic curves have captivated mathematicians for over a century due to their intricate structure and versatile applications. Historically, they have been employed to address problems such as:

Congruent Number Problem: Classifying positive integers that can represent the area of a right-angled triangle with rational side lengths.

Fermat's Last Theorem: Demonstrating that the equation  has no nonzero integer solutions for , , and  when .

In 1985, Neal Koblitz and Victor Miller independently introduced elliptic curves as a basis for public-key cryptographic systems. Since then, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been widely studied for its security and efficiency. By the late 1990s, ECC gained commercial traction with its inclusion in accredited standards and security products.

This repository provides MATLAB implementations to complement the introductory chapter of the ECC Crypto Guide. The chapter introduces the fundamental goals of cryptography and contrasts symmetric-key cryptography with public-key cryptography, focusing on the advantages of elliptic curve cryptography.
